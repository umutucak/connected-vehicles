    "This assignement is separated in 3 parts related to visual percepetion: \n",
    "- In the first, you will learn about creating an image classification model from nothing.\n",
    "- In the second, you will use and fine-tune a detection model.\n",
    "- In the third, you will learn how to use this model in a simulation environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we will learn how to tackle the complex problem of classifying traffic signs. These signs come in many shapes, colors and forms, and it is hard even for us to express how exactly we identify traffic signs. This makes learning from actual data an ideal fit for this problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "The following concepts will be covered in this Lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Loading data in a format suitable for learning algorithms\n",
    "1. Implementation of a Softmax Classifier in plain PyTorch\n",
    "1. Performance assessment in machine learning\n",
    "1. GPU Implementation of complex classification models using PyTorch\n",
    "1. Regularization in the context of neural networks (data augmentation, dropout, early stopping)\n",
    "1. Fine-tuning a pre-trained detection model to fit an application\n",

There are hundreds of ways to proceed, eg. by changing contrast, lightly blurring images, flipping them horizontally, taking crops, adding light noise on them, ... Be creative! A combination of search engine use and the `transform` module of the `torchvision` library might be very helpful for this. You can implement this in a flexible way by simply adding an `augment(x)` functiont that applies a random augmentation on a batch `x` and call it inside the training loop.\n",

    "You should aim the best possible accuracy on the test set (95%+ is a good milestone). Of course, you should not use performance on the test set to tune your model, only the validation set.
